MontyHall_Original.py - 
  - Python Script for simulation of Monty Hall problem with 3 doors. 
  - User will have choice to select number of iterations. 
  - The script will choose to switch the door everytime. 
  - The result should be over 66%. 
  - Recommendation: Try for at least 100 iterations or above.

MontyHall_UserChoice.py -
  - This is the real-life user-based simulation.
  - User will be given a choice to select the door.
  - Also, user will be given a choice to 'switch' or 'stay'.

MontyHall_100doors.py -
  - This is simulation of 100 door analogy of the Monty Hall Problem where the win % increases to near 99% if door is switched.
  - Make changes in Line 37 for the number of iterations you want to simulate for this.

MontyHall_results.xlsx -
  - Shared the results I tracked for the simulation of Original Monty Hall problem.
